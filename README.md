## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

Create a next app, then get frustrated with grid justify, align, place, etc.

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - Simple state management
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) - Uh, yeah, CSS, but with modules.
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)


### What I learned

- Start simple - build the smallest component first
- When components get too complicated, break em down.


### Continued development

Keep practising layouts using grid and flex.
